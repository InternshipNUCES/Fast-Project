                About Website:

            </h1>
            <h3 class="myh2">
                This website is designed specially for the students of FAST university specifically for BS DS students Section B. Here anyone can ask the developer (Hasaan) to add any type of data which is relevent to helpDesk. Also the CR can add the anouncements to the website as well.

            </h3>
            <h1 class="myh2">Point of Website: </h1>
            <p class="myh2">As we all know that we do not really need a website for the data. I mean we have the whatsApp groups and GCS for help. BUT the point is that having a website is like having an intellectual Property on the Internet. Also we can Proudly say that we have our own central spot to put important data Unlike other students of the university. So having a website is good as it boosts our confidence against Many seniors. We can proudly say to our seniors that we have a website even though we are at the first Semester of the University. </p>
        
            <h1 class="myh2">Case Of Troubleshoot:</h1>
            <p class="myh2">In case of any trouble on the website or any Bug , You can report to the Developer. So  feel free to talk to me whenever someone finds the bug or if he/she wants to add the content to any part of website.</p>


            <h1 class="myh2">Future Plans:</h1>
            <p class="myh2">In future , I am planning to add Blog posting to the website as well. Since blog Posting is a good habit and it keeps the mentality fresh , thats why its a big feature but soon it would be available for You guys :-D.<p>
